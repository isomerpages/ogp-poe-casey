<p>We access financial information online, shop on retailers’ websites and
share personal details on social media accounts. As we increasingly use
and rely on digital platforms, we become more exposed to various cybersecurity
risks. Malicious hackers exploit security vulnerabilities to capitalize
on people’s personal data and organizations’ growing digital footprints.</p>
<p>Learn about the prevalence of cyberattacks, including common threats and
vulnerabilities, and the importance of safeguarding personal information.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>Cybersecurity Fast Facts</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>There were 2,365 cyberattacks in 2023, with 343,338,964 victims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2023 saw a 72% increase in data breaches since 2021, which held the previous
all-time record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Around the world, a data breach cost $4.88 million on average in 2024.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Email is the most common vector for malware, with around 35% of malware
delivered via email in 2023.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ninety-four percent of organizations have reported email security incidents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Business email compromises accounted for over $2.9 billion in losses in
2023.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information security jobs are projected to grow by 32% between 2022 and
2032.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As the globe becomes more interconnected and reliant on digital technologies,
cybercrime is surging. The year 2023 saw a notable increase in cyberattacks,
resulting in more than 343 million victims. Between 2021 and 2023, data
breaches rose by 72%, surpassing the previous record.</p>
<p>People around the world use email for personal and professional communication,
making email a target for cybercriminals and the most common vector for
malware. In 2023, 35% of malware was delivered via email, and more than
94% of organizations reported email security incidents.</p>
<p>The repercussions of cyberattacks are far-reaching and costly. A data
breach costs $4.88 million on average in 2024. In 2023, compromised business
emails accounted for more than $2.9 billion in losses. These alarming figures
emphasize the danger of cyber vulnerabilities and highlight the need for
skilled cybersecurity professionals.</p>
<h3><strong>Personal Data Breaches</strong></h3>
<p>Due to the interconnected nature of digital systems and the vast amount
of personal information stored online, cybercrime is often a gateway to
identity theft. Hackers leverage methods like phishing emails, malware
and data breaches to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, including
social security numbers, login credentials and financial information.</p>
<p>The year 2013 saw one of the biggest data breaches in history when more
than 3 billion Yahoo user accounts were compromised. Hackers targeted Yahoo’s
database to steal records from user accounts. And in 2019, Facebook was
the target of a massive data breach where 533 million users’ personal information
was leaked.</p>
<p>In 2023 alone, more than 349 million people were impacted by data breaches.
This alarming trend is further underscored by the number of reports received
by the Consumer Sentinel Network in 2023. Among these reports, fraud accounted
for more than 2.6 million reports, while identity theft constituted over
one million.</p>

<h3><strong>The Cost of Cybercrime</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The total cost of damages incurred by cybercrime is expected to reach
$10.5 trillion by 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The United States has the world’s highest average data breach cost at
$9.36 million.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average cost of a data breach in the healthcare industry is $9.77
million.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost of cybercrime is projected to reach a staggering $10.5 trillion
by 2025. In addition to compromising sensitive information and jeopardizing
the safety of users and customers, cyberattacks have steep financial repercussions.</p>
<p>Remediation efforts, legal fees, regulatory fines, intellectual property
theft, operational disruption and reputational damage are several factors
that account for the total cost of cybercrime. Average costs also vary
by location and targeted industry. Data breaches that occur in the United
States are the costliest worldwide, averaging $9.36 million per incident,
and breaches occurring in the healthcare sector are more expensive than
in other industries. At an average cost of $9.77 million, healthcare-related
data breaches exceed the cost of finance industry breaches—the second-most
expensive—by almost $3.7 million.</p>
