<p>We access financial information online, shop on retailers’ websites and
share personal details on social media accounts. As we increasingly use
and rely on digital platforms, we become more exposed to various cybersecurity
risks. Malicious hackers exploit security vulnerabilities to capitalize
on people’s personal data and organizations’ growing digital footprints.</p>
<p>Learn about the prevalence of cyberattacks, including common threats and
vulnerabilities, and the importance of safeguarding personal information.</p>

<p>As the globe becomes more interconnected and reliant on digital technologies,
cybercrime is surging. The year 2023 saw a notable increase in cyberattacks,
resulting in more than 343 million victims. Between 2021 and 2023, data
breaches rose by 72%, surpassing the previous record.</p>
<p>People around the world use email for personal and professional communication,
making email a target for cybercriminals and the most common vector for
malware. In 2023, 35% of malware was delivered via email, and more than
94% of organizations reported email security incidents.</p>
<p>The repercussions of cyberattacks are far-reaching and costly. A data
breach costs $4.88 million on average in 2024. In 2023, compromised business
emails accounted for more than $2.9 billion in losses. These alarming figures
emphasize the danger of cyber vulnerabilities and highlight the need for
skilled cybersecurity professionals.</p>
<h3><strong>The Cost of Cybercrime</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The total cost of damages incurred by cybercrime is expected to reach
$10.5 trillion by 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The United States has the world’s highest average data breach cost at
$9.36 million.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average cost of a data breach in the healthcare industry is $9.77
million.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost of cybercrime is projected to reach a staggering $10.5 trillion
by 2025. In addition to compromising sensitive information and jeopardizing
the safety of users and customers, cyberattacks have steep financial repercussions.</p>
<p>Remediation efforts, legal fees, regulatory fines, intellectual property
theft, operational disruption and reputational damage are several factors
that account for the total cost of cybercrime. Average costs also vary
by location and targeted industry. Data breaches that occur in the United
States are the costliest worldwide, averaging $9.36 million per incident,
and breaches occurring in the healthcare sector are more expensive than
in other industries. At an average cost of $9.77 million, healthcare-related
data breaches exceed the cost of finance industry breaches—the second-most
expensive—by almost $3.7 million.</p>
