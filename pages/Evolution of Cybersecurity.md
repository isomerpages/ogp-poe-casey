<p>When <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/ENIAC" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>ENIAC</u></a>, the
first modern computer, was brought online in 1945, cybersecurity wasn’t
a word you could find in the dictionary. The only way to interact with
the building-sized computers of the era was to be physically present, so
virtual threats weren’t a risk, and access control was a matter of physical
security.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity developed as a distinct field throughout the 1960s and 70s
and exploded into the public consciousness in the late 1980s, after a series
of events that highlighted just how dangerous a lack of security could
be. Continuing to grow throughout the 90s, cybersecurity is now a core
part of modern life. Let’s explore the brief history of this field!</p>
<h3><strong>Origins</strong></h3>
<p>When you hear the word “hacker”, you probably think of a mysterious individual
sitting alone in a dark room, watching information scroll by on multiple
windows as they conduct nefarious deeds.</p>
<p>The media often takes creative liberties when depicting hackers. It may
surprise you to learn that the origin of the ‘modern hacker’ was a counterculture
of people tinkering with technology or finding new ways of sharing information.
Hacking is not innately tied to breaking into computers. In fact, an early
instance of hacking in 1963 involved hacking a phone system to make long-distance
calls for free. Hacking is the act of working within the confines of a
system to produce unintended behavior. That behavior ranges from cracking
passwords to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-is-the-actual-hack-that-saved-the-astronauts-of-th-1598385593" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>saving a spaceship’s air system using spare parts</u></a>.</p>
<h3><strong>The 1960’s</strong></h3>
<p>The more connected we are, the more important cybersecurity is, and the
widespread adoption of time-sharing in the 60s was a big increase in connectivity.
Computers of the era were expensive and bulky; timesharing let multiple
people use a single large computer at the same time, which meant that precautions
were needed to prevent unauthorized access to files and to the computer
itself. Computing time was expensive in those days! The solution of protecting
accounts with passwords has persisted to modern times.</p>
<h3><strong>The 1970’s</strong></h3>
<p>The creation of <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/arpanet" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>ARPANET</u></a>,
the earliest form of the internet, gave hackers a lot to think about and
explore. ARPANET was a testing ground for new technologies, and the hacker
and technical communities busied themselves with developing and prototyping
new technologies, including email. There were a few adventures into the
development of malware (short for malicious software), including Creeper
and Reaper, the first computer worms, but these were academic exercises
more than anything else.</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'M THE CREEPER; CATCH ME IF YOU CAN</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The message you would have seen if you received a visit from Creeper!</em>
</p>
<p>In this era of rapid development and experimentation, the security of
the technology being developed was not a concern. The widespread view of
ARPANET as a cooperative academic endeavor and the absence of well-established
best practices meant that the motivation and means to design secure systems
and software were limited. However, people were starting to think about
security. A 1975 paper titled <em><a href="https://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/protection/" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>The Protection of Information in Computer Systems</u></a></em> presented
principles and concepts that would become critical to cybersecurity in
the future.</p>
<h3><strong>The 1980’s</strong></h3>
<p>The 1980s were a chaotic time; the Internet was formed in 1983, and the
adoption of the Internet Protocol Suite by ARPANET and other networks added
more potential targets and attackers to the mix. The first “real” malware
emerged during this time, as did the public panic around The Cold War.
Tools and techniques developed during this era would become common in modern
cybersecurity; dictionary attacks used stolen lists of passwords and exploited
weak default credentials, while decoy computer systems trapped attackers.</p>
<p>The late 80’s gave two major events.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The first was the discovery that a hacker working for the KGB gained access
to sensitive documents from the U.S. military.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second was the creation of the world’s truly serious piece of malware:
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Morris Worm</u></a>.
It was originally written to map the size of the internet but quickly grew
out of control, choking computers with multiple copies of itself, and clogging
the network as it kept replicating.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These incidences exploited unsecured default settings; default passwords
like “admin” ensured a system or piece of software was easily exploitable.</p>
<h3><strong>The 1990’s</strong></h3>
<p>The 1990s are widely considered to be the era of viruses. Computers that
connected to the internet became more common in households and this increased
access. This led to unskilled <em>script kiddies</em> — individuals who download
a piece of code and run it without having to write any code themselves.
They can use that code to launch attacks they don’t understand in order
to vandalize or destroy targets for fun.</p>
<p>The unfocused, scattered attacks of the era led to the rise of the anti-malware
industry, evolving from a curiosity to a core part of modern cybersecurity.
Cybersecurity, as a whole, started to be taken much more seriously. Large
companies made public pushes to improve the security of their products.
Household computers were often targeted by the rampant malware of the era,
demonstrating the consequences of poor cybersecurity to their owners.</p>
<h3><strong>The 2000’s</strong></h3>
<p>More and more data became digitized — particularly monetary transactions.
As the script kiddies of the 90s grew up and gained more experience, the
scale of threats shifted, and attackers started having larger targets beyond
vandalism and destruction. Credit-card breaches, hacktivism, and holding
corporations’ systems for ransom became increasingly common, as malicious
hackers realized there was real money to be made from cybercrime.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of sets of credit card data were breached over the
course of the decade.</p>
<p>The threats of data breaches and ransomware attacks forced large businesses
to improve their cybersecurity programs. Being hacked was no longer just
a matter of vandalism; it could lead to extended downtime, loss of customer
loyalty, lawsuits, and fines from regulatory bodies.</p>
<h3><strong>The 2010’s</strong></h3>
<p>During the 2010s, the scale of threats continued to grow: Attacks by nation-states
increased in frequency, and they carried out infiltration and surveillance
campaigns and deployed cyberweapons to attack strategic objectives. Malicious
hacker groups targeted major corporations and government organizations,
stealing data and launching ransomware attacks, and the growing number
of smart devices in circulation gave these groups an entirely new type
of target.</p>
<p>The most dangerous of these new threat actors are known as APTs: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Advanced Persistent Threats</u></a>.
Often funded by nation-states, APTs possess resources and determination
far beyond what smaller threat actors might have access to. While lesser
threat actors might be capable of launching <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/cybersecurity/cyber-attack" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>cyber attacks</u></a> against
a target, APTs are capable of running entire cyber-campaigns, attempting
to infiltrate their target across multiple domains simultaneously.</p>
<p>Large-scale cybersecurity incidents became more and more common: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>WannaCry</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>NotPetya</u>
</a>caused global damage, the [Equifax) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_data_breaches" class="gamut-1r92bn9-AnchorBase e14vpv2g0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>Yahoo!</u></a> breaches
revealed hundreds of millions of pieces of personal information, and countless
companies and organizations were hit by ransomware attacks, bringing their
operations grinding to a halt.</p>
<h3><strong>The present</strong></h3>

<p>With the world as connected as it is, cybersecurity is about protecting
people as much as it is about protecting computers. People are fallible,
and, like computers, we have vulnerabilities that can be exploited: Emotional
manipulation and social engineering are powerful tools, used by hackers
to gain access to secure systems. Many of the systems we rely on run on
computers, and the stakes for protecting them have never been higher. Attacks
on those computers can disrupt transportation, power, economy, healthcare,
communication, and even lives.</p>
<p>With computers so integrated into our lives, it’s crucial that we protect
them. In cybersecurity, we must learn from our mistakes, applying the lessons
learned in the past to prevent attacks in the future. This is the domain
of security researchers and ethical hackers: Finding and fixing vulnerabilities
before they can be exploited, and helping to make us and our computers
as safe as possible.</p>
