<h1>How to train employees on cyber security</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The pandemic set a major shift toward remote work across the globe. As
of <a href="https://wfhresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GSWA-2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>May 2023</u></a>,
nearly 8% of employees work from home full-time, while more than 25% work
a hybrid model. While many employees enjoy the flexibility that WFH brings,
the use of employee-owned devices, unsecured connections, and improper
device usage leave companies vulnerable to a host of network intrusions.
This is why training employees on cyber security is a must.</p>
<h3>Why is training employees on cyber security important?</h3>
<p>When it comes to cyber security, you must take a proactive approach. According
to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, organizations “should
assume that malicious parties will gain control of telework client devices
and attempt to recover sensitive data from them or leverage the devices
to gain access to the enterprise network.”</p>
<p><strong>Here are three quick statistics that highlight the importance of training employees in cyber security awareness:</strong>

<h3>How to train employees on cyber security: 10 tips for success</h3>
<p>To minimize the risk of a network intrusion, it’s necessary to bolster
your first line of defense against external threats—AKA training your employees
on cybersecurity best practices. Here are our expert tips for how to train
employees on cyber security, both in-person and remote.</p>
<h4>1. Develop a cyber security policy</h4>
<p>It’s hard to get your employees to follow the rules if they don’t know
what they are. The question is, do you know what they are?</p>
<p>The first step to training employees on cyber security is developing a
company-wide cyber security and device policy. These policies should be
formally documented and shared with all employees upon hiring. But don’t
let it stop there. Engage in discussions with employees about security
policies periodically throughout employment, and test them periodically
to ensure ongoing adherence to policies.</p>
<h4>2. Help your employees understand cyber security</h4>
<p>The next step to getting employees acquainted with cybersecurity education
is to outline a clear message about your company’s cyber security policies,
training, and plans in place.&nbsp; Such a message needs to be understandable,
relatable, and diversified.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Understandable </strong>– Avoid technical jargon that may confuse
employees and cloud your message. When possible, use simplified terms that
are accessible to the non-tech-minded layman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Relatable</strong> – When talking about external threats, make
it less about the central network and more about personal computer safety
and home network intrusion. This way, employees can personally relate to
the danger if it’s framed in terms of their phone or laptop. This enables
them to have a personal stake in the security plan: no one wants to be
the reason for a <a href="https://preyproject.com/blog/how-to-prevent-data-breaches-5-essential-tips" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>data breach</u></a> that
affects the whole company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diversified</strong> – A simple email outlining everything may
not be enough. Think about how many emails the individual employee receives.
By diversifying your communications strategy, you can ensure that employees
read the message instead of dismissing it as just another announcement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Make following protocol a priority</h4>
<p>In the event of a data breach, it’s important for employees to know the
proper protocol. This should include steps such as reporting any suspicious
activity, changing passwords regularly, and keeping software up to date.
Make sure these protocols are clearly communicated and emphasized to your
employees.</p>
<p>In addition to external threats, educating employees about internal threats
is crucial. This includes actions such as sharing confidential information
with unauthorized individuals or using company devices for personal use.
By creating a culture of security awareness within the company, employees
will be more likely to report any suspicious behavior from their colleagues
or themselves.</p>
<h4>4. Provide regular cyber training and updates</h4>
<p>All employees should undergo cyber security training during their onboarding
process, but regular training is important for all employees. Cyber security
training should cover potential threats and how to prevent them. This can
include <a href="https://preyproject.com/blog/what-is-phishing-and-spear-phishing" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>phishing scams</u></a>,
social engineering tactics, and malware protection. It's also important
to have a designated IT team or individual who can handle any security
incidents that may occur.</p>
<p>There are plenty of online resources for training employees on cybersecurity
awareness, and not all of them have to be paid.</p>
<p><strong>For management:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>

measures, and response actions for remote employees.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Encourage taking great care of your devices</h4>
<p>A Forrester survey found that 15% of company breaches are caused by
<a href="https://preyproject.com/blog/things-to-remember-when-training-employees-for-mobile-security" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>lost or missing devices</u>
</a>. Whether it’s a corporate or personal device, training your employees
about cybersecurity includes bringing awareness that their gadget acts
as a gateway to your organization’s network. This makes it important to
take care of their device and use it properly, even in the confines of
their home.</p>
<p><strong>Help increase good device ownership by conducting the following:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Teach the difference between personal and corporate usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make it mandatory to have a work account that’s subject to monitoring,
restricted installations, and web filtering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beware of old-fashioned loss and theft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure security patches and OS updates are followed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A device management and monitoring solution can help mitigate risk by
automating the push updates and tracking the device’s status and its location
at all times. But this should only serve as a backup, and end-user security
best practices should rest with the employee.</p>
<h4>6. Teach employees how to spot suspicious activity</h4>
<p><strong>Improve your employees' eyes in spotting suspicious activities to enhance their cybersecurity awareness by teaching them to watch for the following signs:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sudden appearance of new apps or programs on their devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strange pop-ups during startup, normal operation, or before shutdown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The device slows down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New extensions or tabs in the browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of control of the mouse or keyboard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Encourage your employees to report suspicious signs immediately. Even
if it turns out to be a false alarm, it might still be beneficial to the
employee by clearing up errors in their device that hamper productivity.</p>
<h4>7. Reinforce confidentiality</h4>
<p>Working from home tends to make people more complacent, which extends
to cybersecurity. Drill the importance of passwords and authentication
even if they work in their PJs. Just because they’re relaxed doesn’t mean
security has to be. <strong>To avoid cybersecurity threats regarding confidentiality, train your employees by conducting the following:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Enact periodic and unique password changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teach employees about the dangers of using universal passwords, and use
real-world examples from past data breaches. They might even want to see
if their personal account passwords have been pawned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss the rationale behind VPNs, multi-factor authentication, and other
secure log-on processes and why they are important (despite being time-consuming).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To combat unsecured storage of company data, provide concrete examples
of stolen data incidents caused by an errant thumb drive or compromised
personal Dropbox account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>8. Examine individual cases of cybersecurity breaches</h4>
<p>Unlike an office environment with a controlled network, your employees’
home computer security can vary widely. Some may connect through their
home Wi-Fi, while others may use connections from the public Wi-Fi at a
coffee shop. <strong>Some may have older devices that are no longer supported by security patches, and it may be necessary to address those concerns by:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Encouraging employees to use their company-provided devices. If it’s BYOD,
check the device brand and model year to see if there are outstanding exploits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do a security sweep of home networks. For example, some older routers
may have weaker WEP protocols instead of WPA-2, or some may even have the
default password!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay attention to nomad employees and devise a security policy for them
since roaming data or public Wi-Fi hotspots bring their unique threats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>9. Require backup of important data</h4>
<p>Emphasize that data belongs to the company and must be backed up regularly
to prevent loss in case of device failure or cyber-attack. Encourage employees
to use company-provided cloud storage solutions or external hard drives
for backups—never their personal devices—and remind them to back up their
work at the end of each day, especially if they have made significant changes
or additions. <strong>Here are some tips to keep in mind:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Regular backups are a vital part of maintaining good cybersecurity practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide information on how to set up automatic backups using software
programs or built-in features on devices. This can help ensure that important
data is always backed up without requiring manual intervention from employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage employees to periodically check their backup files to make sure
they are intact and usable in the event of a cyberattack.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>10. Make cybersecurity awareness an ongoing conversation</h4>
<p>On average, corporate workers spend up to a quarter of their workday on
email-related tasks. This makes a one-shot email message about cybersecurity
a poor choice, since they may not be able to appreciate the significance
or absorb the information in one sitting. <strong>Here are some best practices to take with outlining a cybersecurity announcement to your employees:</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Use different approaches to cybersecurity education, such as regular announcements
or newsletter updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each update, follow the KISS rule: Keep It Short and Simple. This
way, they can glean the message and retain the information amid their hectic
day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow current trends. If there’s a new type of crypto-malware or exploit
that crashes phones with a single message, make sure it reaches your members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use eye-catching tactics each time to get them to absorb the message.
Instead of listing dry statistics or do’s and don’ts, try colorful infographics.
For long topics, try a video explanation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can even try cybersecurity tests to see if the lessons stick. For
example, as part of its email safety education, HP sends out test phishing
messages and congratulates employees who report it to IT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>Training your employees about cybersecurity awareness allows them to understand
how they play a role in protecting your company. Rather than being just
another cog in the organization, they are the first set of eyes that guard
against external threats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Effective cybersecurity awareness relies on clear communication and continuous
education for a robust defense against evolving security challenges. Encouraging
vigilance and good cybersecurity awareness is something your employees
will carry well beyond the confines of the office.</p>
