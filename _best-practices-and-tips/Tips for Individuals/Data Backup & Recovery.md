<p>Have you ever lost a lot of important&nbsp;<a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/how-to/ten-ways-to-keep-your-data-private" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>data</u></a>?
Or, short of&nbsp;that, have you ever felt a moment of panic where you
thought you did?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s images of a family vacation, a report from work, or&nbsp;a
semester’s worth of homework, you probably have data on your computer’s&nbsp;
<a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/how-to/wipe-your-old-drive-clean" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>hard drive</u>
</a>&nbsp;or your mobile&nbsp;device that’s too valuable to lose. That’s where
a data backup comes in.&nbsp;There’s even an entire day dedicated to its
importance:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.worldbackupday.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>World Backup Day</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But a backup strategy isn’t something to focus on just one day&nbsp;of
the year. It should be a regular part of your&nbsp;<a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/how-to/good-cyber-hygiene" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>cyber hygiene</u></a>.
To that end,&nbsp;consider this your ultimate guide to backing up your
data.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What is a data&nbsp;backup?&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>A data backup is a copy or archive of the important information&nbsp;stored
on your devices such as a computer, phone, or&nbsp;<a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/emerging-threats/why-smartphones-and-tablets-need-security-software" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>tablet</u></a>,
and it’s used&nbsp;to restore that original information in the event of
a data loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data losses can occur in many forms, from hard drive failures to&nbsp;
<a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/emerging-threats/ransomware-what-can-you-do-about-it" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>ransomware</u>
</a>&nbsp;attacks and even&nbsp;human error or&nbsp;<a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/mobile/what-to-do-when-a-device-is-lost-or-stolen" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>physical theft</u></a>.
No matter the&nbsp;misfortune, a data backup could be the respite you’re
looking for to restore&nbsp;the data on your devices. A backup is typically
stored in a secure, separate&nbsp;location from an original device, such
as the&nbsp;<a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/how-to/secure-your-info-in-the-cloud" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>cloud</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This way, whenever you have that crushing feeling that all your&nbsp;hard
work and treasured memories are gone, you can rest assured that a data&nbsp;backup
has your back.</p>
<h3><strong>Types of data&nbsp;backups&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>When deciding on a backup data storage strategy, there are&nbsp;different
types of data backups you can perform to help&nbsp;<a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/how-to/how-to-protect-personal-information-online" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>protect your&nbsp;personal data</u></a>.
Depending on the size of the data you’d like to protect and&nbsp;the frequency
with which you’d like to back it up, you can decide between these&nbsp;three
data backup options:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Full backups</strong>: This method backs up every single file&nbsp;on
your device. Because of this, the process could take many hours depending
on&nbsp;the size of the data. A full backup is recommended when you’re
backing up your&nbsp;data for the first time.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Differential backups</strong>: With a&nbsp;differential backup,
you’re only backing up files that have changed or have&nbsp;been added
since your last full backup. Because of this, differential backups&nbsp;can
be performed much more quickly than a full backup.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incremental backups</strong>: Like a&nbsp;differential backup,
incremental backups also only back up data that has been&nbsp;changed or
added since the last backup. The difference is that incremental&nbsp;backups
will back up any changed data since the last backup, whether it was a&nbsp;full,
differential, or incremental backup. These types of backups are often&nbsp;performed
by backup software because they can be done frequently due to their&nbsp;small
size and fast backup time.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you understand what a data backup is and the different&nbsp;types
of backups you can choose from, let’s look at the importance of backing&nbsp;up
your data.</p>
<h3><strong>What is the&nbsp;importance of a data backup?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The main reason for a data backup is to have a secure archive of&nbsp;your
important information, whether that’s classified documents for your&nbsp;business
or treasured photos of your family, so that you can restore your&nbsp;device
quickly and seamlessly in the event of data loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-2022-backup-survey-54-report-data-loss-with-only-10-backing-up-daily/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>20%</u></a>&nbsp;of
people have&nbsp;never backed up their devices as of 2022. This might not
seem like a lot —&nbsp;until you put it in perspective with how often data
is lost:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>113</strong> phones are lost or stolen every minute. (<a href="https://www.worldbackupday.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>World Backup Day</u></a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>30%</strong> of all computers are already compromised with malware.
(<a href="https://www.worldbackupday.com/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>World Backup Day</u></a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>98%</strong> of stolen laptops are never found. (<a href="https://www.technology.pitt.edu/security/laptop-theft" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>University of&nbsp;Pittsburgh</u></a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Over 70 million</strong> cell phones are lost each year. (<a href="https://www.kensington.com/news/news-press-center/2011-news--press-center/kensington-extends-its-leadership-in-security-to-smartphones-innovative-bungeeair-keeps-phones-and-content-secure/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Kensington</u></a>)&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, think of a data backup as the bedrock of your digital&nbsp;disaster
recovery plan. By backing up your devices, you’re already one step&nbsp;ahead
of any cyberthreats that might result in data loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s worth noting, however, that data loss isn’t always the&nbsp;result
of cyberthreats. It can also be the case that your external hard drive&nbsp;or&nbsp;
<a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/how-to/donate-your-computer-laptop-smartphone" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>computer wears&nbsp;out</u>
</a>&nbsp;and you lose your data. That’s just the nature of any piece of hardware,
and&nbsp;backing up your data can help you restore it on a&nbsp;<a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/iot/iot-device-security" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>new device</u></a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>What is a 3-2-1&nbsp;backup strategy? + data backup best practices&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>3-2-1 </strong>backup strategy is a method that ensures your
data is&nbsp;appropriately copied and consistently recoverable. The concept:
Create three&nbsp;copies of your data on at least two storage solutions,
one of which is stored&nbsp;remotely.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Three copies:</strong> This ensures that every individual piece&nbsp;of
data has two duplicates to protect against corrupted files or lost data&nbsp;backups.&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Two different storage methods</strong>: By using two&nbsp;separate
and different storage methods, you can protect yourself from losing&nbsp;everything
if one storage method fails.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>One copy off-site:</strong> Additionally, utilizing a remote&nbsp;storage
option can protect against risks associated with local outages or other&nbsp;unpredictable
problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of options when it comes to backing up your&nbsp;data,
each with its own procedures and parameters. But no matter what data&nbsp;backup
option you choose, there are best practices you should consider when&nbsp;creating
your own data backup strategy.&nbsp;</p>
