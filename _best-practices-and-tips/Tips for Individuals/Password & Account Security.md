<h3>Creating Strong Passwords and Other Ways To Protect Your Accounts</h3>
<p>You create and keep lots of personal information in your online accounts,
so you want good protections in place. Here’s how to protect your accounts
with strong passwords and other security methods.</p>
<h4>Create a Strong Password</h4>
<p>When you set up an online account, you’re usually asked to create a password.
To protect your account from cyberattacks, create a strong password that’s
hard to guess. How? Start by making your password long — aim for at least
12 characters.</p>
<p>Of course, a long password can be hard to remember. You may find it easier
to use a passphrase — a series of words separated by spaces. But make sure
that your passphrase consists of <em>random</em> words. Avoid using common
phrases, song lyrics, or movie quotes that are easy for a hacking program
to guess.</p>
<p>If the account doesn’t allow long passwords, mix uppercase and lowercase
letters, numbers, and symbols to make your password strong.</p>
<p>Studies show that people aren’t very good at creating random, strong passwords,
or remembering them. So, what to do? One option is to have your web or
mobile browser create a password for you.</p>
<p>Another option is to use a third-party password manager to create a strong
password — and remember it. To find a reputable password manager, read
expert reviews. Make sure the password you’re using with the password manager
is strong and secure.</p>
<p>A web browser, mobile browser, and password manager all can save your
passwords for you.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Use Multi-factor Authentication</h4>
<p>A strong password is an important first step in protecting your account
from hackers. But even strong passwords are vulnerable to cyberattacks.
Using <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/use-two-factor-authentication-protect-your-accounts" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">multi-factor authentication</a> means
a hacker who steals your password can’t log in to your account without
another authentication factor.</p>
<p>The most common type of multi-factor authentication is a verification
passcode you get by text message or email. This one-time passcode is typically
six digits or longer and it expires automatically. But this is the least
secure type of two-factor authentication, so choose a more secure method
like an <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/use-two-factor-authentication-protect-your-accounts#app" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">authenticator app</a> or
a <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/use-two-factor-authentication-protect-your-accounts#key" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">security key</a> for
more protection, if you have the option.</p>
<h4>Pick Security Questions Only You Can Answer</h4>
<p>When you create an account, you may have to give answers to a few security
questions. Some sites may periodically ask you to answer these questions
as a security measure to confirm your identity. You also may have to answer
them if you need to reset your password.</p>
<p>Hackers could try to guess your answers to get into your account, so pick
security questions only you can answer. Avoid questions with a limited
number of responses that hackers can guess — like the color of your first
car. And skip questions with answers that someone could find online or
in public records — like your zip code, birthplace, or mother’s maiden
name. If you can’t avoid those questions, treat them like a password and
use random and long answers. Just be sure you can remember your answers.
As with a password, make sure the question and answer are unique, not one
that you use on other sites.</p>
<h4>Change Your Password If Someone Steals It</h4>
<p>If a company or website tells you it lost your password in a data breach,
change your password right away. Follow the advice above and create a new
strong password. If you reused the same password, or a similar one, on
other services, change it there, too.</p>
